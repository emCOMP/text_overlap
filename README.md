# text_overlap
This respository is for the text overlap portion of the DISINFO group.
Article similarity refers to the actual analysis of the articles - text similarity, graphing, paths, etc.
Data cleaning is scripts trying to clean up our spreadsheet of articles.
Ngrams includes other explorations such as longest common ngram and counts of lengths of common ngrams.
Authors includes explorations around author references.
Note that many scripts require files from other folders to run - so you may not be able to run a script straight from a clone of the repository (e.g. many scripts rely on scraped_filtered_aritcles.csv to be in the same folder).
The most up to date article spreadsheet is in the main folder, all other versions are under old_data.
